## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Makefile for comprehensive server management** - Added complete Makefile with commands for server lifecycle management, dependency installation, and project maintenance
  - `make start` - Start the server in background with PID tracking and logging
  - `make stop` - Stop the server using saved PID with proper process validation
  - `make restart` - Stop and restart the server with appropriate delay
  - `make status` - Check if the server is running with PID validation
  - `make install` - Install production dependencies using uv
  - `make dev` - Install development dependencies using uv
  - `make clean` - Clean up temporary files, logs, and Python cache
  - `make help` - Display available commands and usage information

### Fixed

- **Circular import issue** - Resolved circular import between main.py and API modules by extracting TTSManager to dedicated manager.py module
  - Created new `danmu_tts/manager.py` containing TTSManager class and tts_manager instance
  - Updated `main.py` to import tts_manager from manager module instead of defining locally
  - Updated all API modules (tts.py, backends.py, voices.py) to import from `..manager` instead of `..main`
  - Eliminates circular dependency where main.py imported API modules while API modules imported from main.py
